# OOP-Zoo
Lab 06: I built a Zoo!
The Problem Domain
A zoo contains animals, and animals can come in many different shapes and sizes. It is your job to plan and build out what animals live in the zoo.

This is the first part of a 2-part assignment. Lab 07 builds off of Lab 06.

Instructions
Using UML, diagram what animals the zoo will consist of. Include in each class the properties and behaviors for each animal, as well as the relationships between each animal from it's base classes.

Here are some UML resources to help get you started:

UML Overview{:target="_blank"}
OOP and UML{:target="_blank"}
Next, create a new console application that will instantiate each of your concrete animals, and prove that they are inheriting traits/features from their various parent classes.

Your lab should showcase all 4 of the Object Oriented Principles (OOPs).

Implement each of the classes you showcased in your UML within Visual Studio.
There should be at least 3 layers of inheritance with at least 5 different types of animals.
Prove that the behaviors for each class exist or were properly inherited by returning strings as necessary .
Some example methods could be: Eat() Sleep() Sound() etc...
You are allowed to use these example methods within your lab, along with others not listed
Include the following labels:
Label the parent and derived classes
Label the abstract classes and concrete classes
Label the access modifiers for each of the classes
Label where you are using polymorphism in your program. Identify where the virtual and abstract methods are defined, and where are they being overridden.
Your program class should instantiate each of the concrete animals to prove the functionality of it's base classes.
Program Specifications
Your solution should include the following:

Have at least 3 different abstract classes
Have at least 3 layers of inheritance
Have at least 5 concrete animals
Have at least 2 abstract methods (make sure you override them)
Have at least 2 abstract Properties (make sure you override them)
Have at least 2 virtual methods (make sure you override at least one of them)
Have at least 2 virtual properties (make sure you override at least one of them)
Your (digital) drawing of your zoo diagram should be clearly labeled
NOTE: You are not required to be scientifically correct with your animal names. Keep the names of your animals simple. For example you do not need to label your animals anything more complicated than Mammal, Reptile, Cat, Bird, etc...

Unit Tests
Test that your program has the following functionality:

Test that each of your concrete animals exhibit the at least 2 appropriate behaviors given to them from a base class.
